    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pizza dough</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Mozarella cheese</li>
      <li>Pepperoni</li>
      <li>Mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the dough</li>
      In a large mixing bowl, mix flour, yeast, salt, sugar, and warm water. Mix
      everything together until it forms a smooth dough. Cover it with a damp
      cloth and let it rest for about an hour.

      <li>Roll out the dough</li>
      Sprinkle some flour on a clean surface and use your hands or a rolling pin
      to flatten the dough into a round shape. Make sure the dough is evenly
      thin all the way around.
      <li>Add the sauce and cheese</li>
      Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving some space
      around the edges. Then sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.
      Make sure not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, as it can make
      it difficult to cook properly.

      <li>Add your toppings</li>
      Add your desired toppings on top of the cheese. You can choose from a
      variety of meats, vegetables, herbs, or spices. Some popular toppings
      include pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, and basil.

      <li>Bake the pizza</li>
      Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). Place the pizza on a baking sheet or
      pizza stone and bake it for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is
      golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

      <li>Let it cool and enjoy!</li>
      Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before
      slicing it into pieces. Serve it hot and enjoy your delicious homemade
      pizza!
