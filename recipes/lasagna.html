    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish consisting of layers of wide flat
      noodles, tomato sauce, meat, and cheese. The noodles are layered with a
      mixture of ricotta cheese, ground beef or sausage, and tomato sauce.
      Mozzarella cheese is sprinkled on top, and the dish is baked until the
      cheese is melted and bubbly.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>Ground beef</li>
      <li>Mozarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles</li>
      Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add lasagna noodles
      and cook them according to the package instructions until they are tender.
      Then, drain the noodles and set them aside.
      <li>Brown the Meat</li>
      In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the ground beef or sausage
      and cook it until it's no longer pink. Stir occasionally and break it into
      small pieces as it cooks.
      <li>Mix the Cheese Filling</li>
      In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with an egg, some salt, and
      pepper. Mix everything together until it's smooth and creamy.
      <li>Layer the Lasagna</li>
      Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large baking dish, spread a thin
      layer of tomato sauce on the bottom. Then, place a layer of cooked lasagna
      noodles on top of the sauce. Add a layer of the cheese filling and a layer
      of the cooked meat. Repeat the layers until you reach the top of the dish.
      Finish with a layer of tomato sauce and sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
      <li>Bake the Lasagna</li>
      Cover the dish with foil and bake it for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil
      and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and
      bubbly.
      <li>Let it Rest and Serve</li>
      Once the lasagna is done, let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. This
      will allow it to set and make it easier to cut into pieces. Serve the
      lasagna with a side salad or some garlic bread, and enjoy!
