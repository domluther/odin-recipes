    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Cocoa powder</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven</li>
      Ask an adult to help you preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). This will
      make sure your cake bakes perfectly.

      <li>Make the batter</li>
      In a large mixing bowl, mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, eggs, and baking
      powder. Mix everything together until it forms a smooth batter. You can
      use a whisk or a hand mixer to make it easier.

      <li>Grease the pan</li>
      Use a little bit of butter or cooking spray to grease a 9-inch (23 cm)
      round cake pan. This will make sure the cake doesn't stick to the pan.

      <li>Bake the cake</li>
      Pour the batter into the greased cake pan and smooth it out with a
      spatula. Ask an adult to help you put the cake in the oven and bake it for
      about 30-35 minutes. You can check if it's done by inserting a toothpick
      into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready.

      <li>Cool the cake</li>
      Take the cake out of the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10
      minutes. Then, carefully remove it from the pan and let it cool completely
      on a wire rack.

      <li>Frost the cake and serve!</li>
      Once the cake has cooled, spread a thick layer of chocolate frosting over
      the top of the cake. You can use store-bought frosting or make your own by
      mixing powdered sugar, cocoa powder, butter, and milk. Cut the cake into
      slices and serve it to your family and friends. Enjoy your delicious
      homemade chocolate cake!
